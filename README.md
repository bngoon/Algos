## Introduction

Algorithms are the heart of computer science, enabling us to solve complex problems efficiently. This repository serves as a collection of implementations of popular algorithms, ranging from sorting and searching algorithms to graph algorithms and dynamic programming solutions.

## Languages

The algorithms in this repository are implemented in multiple programming languages, including but not limited to:

- Python
- JavaScript

## Usage

Each algorithm implementation is contained in its own directory, organized by language. To use a specific algorithm, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute an algorithm implementation or improve an existing one, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-algorithm`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new algorithm: my-algorithm'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/my-algorithm`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
